A Modular (HMVC) App Building Framework - complete with front end, REST api, and 2 admin areas (Admin / Secure)

- create "blox" modules to build enterprise class web applications
- uses Codeigniter 3.x and Bootstrap 4.x.x
- can be used as a quickstart project starter/boilerplate
- *What are blox?* "Blox" are just pluggable modules or applets that are commonly used in web applications. Ignition Go includes a web-based generator (see BuildABlox). Planned example "blox" would be a bulk emailer, report manager, and many more!!!  



## Features特徵

* 它只把 Public公開(資安?) 
* 有 Cli
* 有 Install/init, 會檢查必要條件, 及資料庫安裝.
* Nginx virtualhost 要設定 
    ```
    alias /var/www/html/ignition_go/public;
    ```
* 支援 HMVC, 還有自己的 blox
* 還有 API (REST API), API_Controller...
* Template, 是一個重要的擴充, 應該值得研究.


### Documentation
Documentation is now available: [Ignition-Go Documentation on GitHub] (http://ci-blox.github.io/Ignition-Go/#/concepts/ACL)
Take a look at the key concepts documents and also see the /docs folder for more.

### Server Requirements (Preferred)

* **PHP 7.3** you can run in lower (5.6) but the recommended version for production to use is [PHP 7.3](http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.php) for your projects.  PHP 7.3 is now supported in the latest code and anything below PHP 7.3 is no longer officially supported.
* **Apache 2.4+** with rewrite mod enabled
* **MySQL 5.5+ or MariaDb**

### Installing 

****NOTE: now using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for packages (so Bower is not needed / optional).

1. GIT clone this repository

Example: git clone https://github.com/ci-blox/Ignition-Go.git myigoapp

2. Either:<br>
2a) use Yarn and Gulpjs (highly recommended for non-experts) - go to step 3<br>
-or-<br>
2b) map your webserver to the 'public' folder to use pre-installed versions of packages<br>
(skip to step 8)<br>

3. Install NPM [node.js](http://nodejs.org/): package manager for node modules, and [install Yarn] (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) 

4. Change directory to new site/web app root<br>
Example: ```cd myigoapp```

5. Install all the packages and components <br>
Type: ```yarn install``` <br>

6. Create an empty mySql or MariaDb database (default db name is ci_blox) and a user (default is root/no password).  Note that the database.php file in application/config contains these configuration settings.<br>

Example: use a tool like HeidiSQL or phpMyAdmin and create both a database and a user with privileges that new database<br> 

7. Run 'gulp' (note that gulp will run continuously in 'watch' mode, watching for css and js changes).<br> then<br>
EITHER type: ```gulp```<br>
OR..  type: ```gulp serve``` 
OR..  type: ```gulp build``` which just rebuilds the JS and CSS

8. (Optional, required if no gulp or in production) In Apache, map the 'public' folder to localhost or other url

Example: in your httpd-vhosts.conf file, add new ```<VirtualHost>``` section and restart Apache

9. Go to http://[your-web-root-from-step-7]/install/init in your browser to finish using install wizard<br> 

eg if you used gulp, goto http://localhost:8080/install/init<br>
if you had created virtual host igotestlocal.com, then go to http://igotestlocal.com/install/init in your browser

### Asset Customization (e.g. additional js/css files)

A gulp configuration (**gulpfile.js**) is included. It utilizes package and component tools from these sites:
* NPM [node.js](http://nodejs.org/): package manager for node modules
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): package manager
* GulpJS [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): task runner to compile, combine, and minify
* Guzzle [guzzle](http://guzzlephp.com/): integrated for use as a REST client or for complex curl operations

### Acknowledgements
Special thanks to the [Bonfire](http://cibonfire.com) project and those who contributed to it - many features and infrastructure concepts were inspired or incorporated outright from that project.  Also thanks to all the projects like GuzzlePHP and countless others that are open source, whose components are incorporated and allow this initiative to exist.  Finally, thanks especially to the CodeIgniter team, with whom CodeIgniter continues to thrive!
